There were small beings in the world. They changed the soil, and no other organisms appeared there. The soil they changed showed no visible difference to the eye. Sand looked like sand, water looked like water. The only thing known was that no organisms lived there.

As their presence covering the Earth diminished, life emerged. At first, small creatures, then large creatures, and finally, humans were born.
