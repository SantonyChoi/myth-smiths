Naturally, humans expanded their territories. What started as mere tribes evolved into nations. And then, wars happened.

In the human realm, there emerged thousands of groups that self-identified as nations. They engaged in conflicts with neighboring nations to conquer more land and resources. In order to stand against a powerful nation, there were also small nations that cooperated with each other. They shared a different form of consciousness under names like alliances or coalitions, distinct from the idea of a nation.

Within these conflicts and cooperations, they grew. The size of individual nations gradually increased, and technology to manage vast organizations developed. They also learned to absorb other groups not through oppression and violence, but by using cultural means. Some even formed giant unions that functioned like a single nation despite being made up of independent countries. There were cases where nations deceived their counterparts into crumbling from within. Human political tools grew increasingly sophisticated.
