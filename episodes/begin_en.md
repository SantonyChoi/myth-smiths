What were the small beings? Their domains contracted gradually over time.

As their domains, which served as barriers dividing the territories of living organisms, shrank, various life forms began to meet in different places. Encounters between different life forms were sometimes peaceful or even majestic, but mostly accompanied by violence. As the dominant predators in their own domains, it was a natural order of things.

Naturally, a hierarchy formed among the life forms. In human society, it was referred to as a food chain, but since not all organisms preyed on others, a more appropriate term was needed. Above all, their hierarchy was not for survival. Each of them was already advanced enough to thrive within their own domains. Therefore, it could be said that their hierarchy was more of a power structure than a food chain. Simply to assert their authority.

Another new belief that emerged was the belief, more like a certainty, that there were other life forms yet to be encountered. This belief soon turned into fear. It was fear of future unknown adversaries. Many life forms began to prepare not only for power struggles within their domains but also for conflicts with unseen beings.

However, a being with the intention to overcome the domains of the small beings had not yet appeared.
