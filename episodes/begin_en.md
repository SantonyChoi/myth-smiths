What were the small beings? Their domain gradually shrunk as time passed.

Their domain was a barrier that divided the space between living beings. As their domain shrank, encounters between different life forms occurred in various places. The encounters between different life forms were generally accompanied by violence. This was a natural course of events as each living being ruled its own domain.

The beings soon established a hierarchy. In human society, this was referred to as the food chain, but since not all beings preyed on each other, a more suitable term was needed. Above all, their hierarchy was not for survival. Each of them was already a developed being capable of sustaining life within their own domain. Therefore, their hierarchy could be more accurately described as a chain of power, rather than a food chain. It was solely to assert their authority.

Another new development was the emergence of belief. It was a belief, bordering on certainty, that other undiscovered life forms existed. This belief soon turned into fear, a fear of future enemies yet to come. Many beings began to prepare not only for power struggles within their domains, but also for conflicts with unseen entities.

The beings observed the changes in the small beings' domain more attentively than before. However, there was no being yet with the intention of overcoming the domain of the small beings.
