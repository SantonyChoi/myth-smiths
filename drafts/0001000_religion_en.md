# Religions Existing in the World

Let's talk about religion. Intelligent beings, especially races who ruled their own territories, shared a common trait: they all had religions.

Religion gave courage to beings facing death without fear of it. Generally, their religions contained beliefs about the afterlife. Ultimately, for beings who must face death, the hope of another life after this one was an invaluable promise that couldn't be replaced by anything else.

There were also beings who did not face certain death. Even for them, religion existed. They needed religion to accept their existence living through endless time. Their religions, from a human perspective, were closer to philosophy. It was a kind of scholarly inquiry into their own existence and the world.

Regardless of the form of religion, it made beings stronger. In fights with other races, in the face of natural disasters, religion gave beings strength.
