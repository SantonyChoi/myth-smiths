# Means of Communication

The most common means of communication was using sound. It was similar to any droplet of water. Sound was a natural and easy means as it existed as a physical phenomenon regardless of the existence of living beings.

Beings who knew how to utilize magic could directly access the consciousness of others to convey their thoughts. In this case, unless both parties knew how to use the same magic, there was a limitation in one-way communication. Therefore, in many cases, they also learned to communicate using sound together.

Light was also a common means of communication. While sense organs that could perceive light were found in many organisms, some had developed the ability to convey subtle thoughts through extremely sophisticated organs. Onlookers watching their communication were sometimes awestruck at their rapidly changing appearance with amazing colors. These beings also became idols in their own right.

From a human perspective, the most unpleasant means was utilizing chemical substances. This method could be dangerous, unpleasant, or disgusting. Of course, from a human perspective.
