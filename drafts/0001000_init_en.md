# Small Beings

There were small beings in the world. They transformed the space, and in the space they transformed, no other creatures appeared. The space occupied by the small beings was no different from any other space. There, the sand looked like sand, water like water, and light like light. The only thing known was that there were no living beings in that place.

As their presence slowly diminished from covering the world, life began to emerge. Gaps in the space created by the small beings were filled with living beings. At first small creatures emerged, then larger ones, and eventually intelligent life forms appeared.

The space where life emerged was like water droplets in the sea. Each formed its own world and did not connect with other worlds. Even the most intelligent beings in each droplet thought that the world they lived in was unique. In this way, countless time passed, and countless worlds were born.
